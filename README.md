# Rooted App Enhancement Walkthrough

The Rooted app has been transformed from a chat tool into a full-featured devotional platform. Users can now read the entire Bible offline, follow structured plans, and reflect on their journey with AI.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Offline Bible Engine
We successfully bundled the full 66-book KJV Bible. Upon the first launch, the app initializes a local SQLite database with over 31,000 verses.
- **Branded Splash**: A minimalist loading screen provides feedback during initialization.
- **Fast Access**: Scripture is retrieved instantly from the device without needing an internet connection.

### 2. Dual 365-Day Reading Plans
Users can now choose between (or follow both) two popular reading tracks:
- **Canonical Journey**: Read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation in order.
- **OT & NT Blended**: A balanced daily track mixing Old and New Testament passages.
- **Progress Tracking**: Every chapter is tracked persistently. You can mark readings as complete directly from the home screen.

### 3. AI-Powered Journal Reflection
The journal is no longer just a static list of thoughts.
- **Resume Reflection**: Clicking "Reflect" on a previous journal entry opens a chat session with the AI.
- **Context Awareness**: The AI is pre-loaded with your entry, allowing for charismatic and empathetic deep-dives into your journey.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Database Initialization
The `bibleLoader.ts` handles the migration from JSON to SQLite in a single transaction for maximum efficiency (~2-3 seconds on modern devices).

### State Management
We used **Zustand** + **AsyncStorage** for `plansStore.ts`, ensuring that your reading progress is never lost even if you close the app.

> [!TIP]
> To test the initialization flow again, you can clear the app data or delete the `rooted.db` file from the app's document directory.

### Next Steps
- Implement **Push Notifications** to remind users of their daily readings.
- Add **Search** functionality for the offline Bible.
